# -Predict-Credit-Risk
## Module 18
Overview of the loan prediction risk analysis:
In this repository you'll find the machine learning jupiter notebook codes that will help you decide if the company 
should give a Loan or not.
The purpose of this analysis is well defined 
The main purpose for this is to reduce the risk of giving loans when the customers are not going to ble able
to pay them, therefore we will look at different variables and decide based on machine learning which ones
have the most weight or correlation towards the loan status.
